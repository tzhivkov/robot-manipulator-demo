# A fun project to make a trajectory planner for an arm and visualise it using Python #

This toy project will be using the FABRIK (forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics) method by A. Aristidou and J. Lasenby <http://andreasaristidou.com/FABRIK.html>.
The project will be entirely based on Python 3 (for now). But I wish to re-write it in C++ at some point.

## Description ##

The initial part of this toy project will be the main functionality (back-end), after which I will focus more on the visualisation and making things look smooth and fluid.

### Part 1: Back-End ###

As I build on the project and I expand my usage of libraries, I will write the relevenat libraries (dependencies) here. 
But I plan on creating a requirements.txt file eventually.

1. FK solver
2. IK solver.
3. Trajectory Planner.
